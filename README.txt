What is it?
-----------

 [PAPER CITATION] used earlier versions of this code to make all figures except the timeline. 


Why are there two versions?
----------------------------

 The EARLIER version is the exact code used to generate the figures. The LATER verson has code that author MC cleaned up the code and commented to facilitate reproducing the figures or repurposing parts of the code. 

Documentation
-------------

 Besides this file, [PAPER CITATION] documents the medthods. No further documentation exists or is planned. However, you may contact the corresponding author of the paper for questions related to this code. 

Installation
------------

 The code is standalone Python code. Nothing needs to be configured or installed.

Dependencies
------------

 The code assumes that you have NumPy, SciPy and Matplotlib installed. A version of Matplotlib greater than 1 is required because the upper x- and right y-axis are hidden by using using commands that are available only in those later versions.
